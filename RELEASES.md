    Includes full support for V3, V4, V5, V7* and V8 zmachine versions, incuding:
    
    * Color text with a color terminal (V5+) 
    * Sound (for `The Lurking Horror` and `Sherlock` when the associated blorb resource files are available) when the `-libsndfile` build is used.
    * Mouse support (for `Beyond Zork`)

\**V7 support is untested.  Version 7 was transitory and rarely used.*
