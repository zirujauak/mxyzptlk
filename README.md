An inform (zmachine) virtual machine implemented in Rust.

## Why?

I want to learn Rust.  The zmachine is a well-documented virtual machine with implementations dating back to 1980 on platforms from the Apple ][ to the (Sinclar) ZX.  I've also worked on other implementations, first porting the [Frotz](https://www.ifwiki.org/Frotz) interpreter to the Apple //gs in the mid 90s and later authoring (unreleased) Java and Clojure implementations.  It seems to be my go-to when I don't have any better ideas.

## What

The general idea is to separate the virtual machine that exeecutes code from the interpreter, which provides the user interface.  I have wild and unexplored ideas of native UX implementations, web implementations, etc.

It's going to be sloppy - I'm still acclimating to the peculiarities of Rust and figuring out what I can get from a library vs. what I have to write myself.
